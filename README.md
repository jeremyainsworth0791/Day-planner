# Day-planner

This application allows a user to schedule their daily events. The planner is broken down by a typical 9-5 work-day, and displays the current date and time. The app also calls attention to upcoming events by dynamically changing the color of each specific time block. The users saved calnder events are saved locally, and will appear even if the user closes or reloads the page.
